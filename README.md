## Introduction

> In this project, I will be Analyzing a No-show appointments Kaggle dataset. The dataset contains collected information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil. Patients make appointments with doctors, they follow all the instructions given to them, and don't show up.   The main objective is to find the factors which influence patient showing up and not showing up for their scheduled appointments 


> The original problem is from [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments/home)

## Findings 
> 79.8% of the patients attended their appointment. <br />
> 20.2% patients missed their appointments. <br />
> The data is only in three quarters. <br />
> The data is distributed in three quarters. <br />
> There are no patients who missed their appointments within the first quarter.<br />
> Over 20,000 patients missed their appointments in the last quarter.  <br />
> The number of missed appointments increased in the month of december 2015. <br />
> The number of missed appointments increased sharply between feb 2016 and march 2016. <br />
> March 2016 has the highest number of missed appointments. <br />
> There is a sharp decline in the number of patients who missed between  April 2016, and june 2016. <br />
> Over time the percentage of male patients missing appointments has been exceeding that of the Female patients. <br />
> The percentange of female patients who missed is greater than that of their male counter parts.
> Patients with alcoholism miss their appointments most followed by handcaped patients. <br />
> Hypertension has the least missed appointments. <br />  
###  Limitations
> There is no data for people who missed appointments in the first quarter. <br />
> Most of the data is concetrated in only two quarters which makes it insufficient to know the exact factors which could influence patient attendence. <br />
