## Introduction

> In this project, I will be Analyzing a No-show appointments Kaggle dataset. The dataset contains collected information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil. Patients make appointments with doctors, they follow all the instructions given to them, and don't show up.   The main objective is to find the factors which influence patient showing up and not showing up for their scheduled appointments 


> The original problem is from [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments/home)

## Findings 
> Most patients live in Jardin Camburi
> Most patients schedule appointments on Tuesday and wednesday. <br />
> No patients schedule appointments on the weekends ie(satuday and sunday). <br />
> Most patients are given appointments on Wednesday and Tuesday. <br />
> 80% of the patients attended their appointment. <br />
> 20% patients missed their appointments. <br />
> Of the total number missed 65% were female while 35% were male. <br />
> 79.6% of the female patients attended their appointment schedules with just 20.4% missing their schedule. <br />
> 80% of the Male patients attended their appointments compaired to the 20% who missed. <br />
  There is 0.4% chance that the female patient is likely to miss compaired to male patients. <br />
